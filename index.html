			<h2>Practice your Spanish!</h2>

			<h3>&iexcl;Practica tu espa&ntilde;ol!</h3>

			<p><em>It's not a class, but a casual conversation in Spanish.</em><br>I sit and talk to people every week
				in a central place of South Minneapolis. There are plenty of subjects to talk about&mdash;the latest
				news, work, cooking, travel. Every subject leads to another. You can always propose one. Immerse
				yourself in another culture. It´s fun!</p>

			<p><em>Don't worry about your level of knowledge.</em><br>
				There are beginners and advanced groups, as well as private sessions. After
				talking about your goals and needs, we will find places and hours that are
				convenient for you.</p>

			<p><em>If you want to help your bilingual staff to keep up their Spanish,<a
					href="mailto:rosa.conversations@gmail.com" target="_blank"> contact Rosa</a> to create basic Spanish
				courses that fit your business needs.</em></p>

			<h2>Group Sessions</h2>

			<p>$15/1.5 hour session per person (Groups of 4 max)</p>

			<p>1 hour private sessions available. (Call for details)</p>

			<h2>Schedule</h2>

			<p>Register now by phone or <a href="mailto:rosa.conversations@gmail.com">email</a>. Space is limited.</p>

			<p>Rosa is from Lima, Per&uacute;. After traveling throughout her own country and other parts of South
				America working in the film and video industry, Rosa moved to Paris, France, where she graduated in
				screenwriting. She then worked in the Dominican Republic, an experience that helped to enriched her
				vocabulary&mdash;every Spanish-speaking country has its own language codes. Back in Peru, she met a
				wonderful man from Minnesota and relocated with him to Minneapolis where they were married. After
				working eight years as a translator/captioner at CaptionMax, she decided to take advantage of her travel
				experiences and communication skills to build what she considers a bridge between the cultures that she
				knows and loves through good old-fashioned conversations. Besides Spanish and English, Rosa also knows
				French and Italian. "This is a global community. A second language will always open doors for you. Don´t
				let that treasure go to waste."</p>
