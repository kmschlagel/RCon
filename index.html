    	<h2>Practice your Spanish!</h2>
        <h3>&iexcl;Practica tu espa&ntilde;ol!</h3>
        
        <p><em>It's not a class, but a casual conversation in Spanish.</em><br>I sit and talk to people every week in a central place of South Minneapolis. There are plenty of subjects to talk about&mdash;the latest news, work, cooking, travel. Every subject leads to another. You can always propose one. Immerse yourself in another culture. It´s fun!</p>

        <p><em>Don't worry about your level of knowledge.</em><br>
        There are beginners and advanced groups, as well as private sessions. After
        talking about your goals and needs, we will find places and hours that are
        convenient for you.</p>
        
        <p><em>If you want to help your bilingual staff to keep up their Spanish,<a href="mailto:rosa.conversations@gmail.com" target="_blank"> contact Rosa</a> to create basic Spanish courses that fit your business needs.</em></p>

        <h2 id="about">About Rosa</h2>
        <div id="about_img"><img src="img/conversations/aboutrosa.jpg" width="250" height="231" alt="Rosa gazing at a mountain"></div>
        <p>Rosa is from Lima, Per&uacute;. After traveling throughout her own country and other parts of South America working in the film and video industry, Rosa moved to Paris, France, where she graduated in screenwriting. She then worked in the Dominican Republic, an experience that helped to enriched her vocabulary&mdash;every Spanish-speaking country has its own language codes. Back in Peru, she met a wonderful man from Minnesota and relocated with him to Minneapolis where they were married. After working eight years as a translator/captioner at CaptionMax, she decided to take advantage of her travel experiences and communication skills to build what she considers a bridge between the cultures that she knows and loves through good old-fashioned conversations. Besides Spanish and English, Rosa also knows French and Italian. "This is a global community. A second language will always open doors for you. Don´t let that treasure go to waste."</p>

    	<h2 id="testimonials">Testimonials</h2>
        <p>"Rosa has the skills to encourage each group member to join in the conversation and the ability to patiently direct them toward correct expression. She's unusually generous in her desire to be helpful. This is exactly the opportunity I'd been looking for to build a comfort level with everyday Spanish." &mdash;Bill</p>
